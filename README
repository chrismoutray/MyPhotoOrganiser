My Photo Organiser

Command line tool to sort photos into folders by date.
By default photos are moved to a sub folder by year, then by date.
Example:
    ".\Photo1.jpg" was taken 21-Jan-2011
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe outputs: ".\2011\20110121\Photo1.jpg"

Usage:
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe <source> [/d <destination>] [/f <file format>] [/c] [/s] [/p] [/l]

Where:
    <source> - source path of photos to sort
    /d - (optional) destination path
        can include .Net string format {0} of the date photo was taken
        default is ".\{0:yyyy}\{0:yyyyMMdd}\"
        ie relative to path <source>\\<year>\\<year><month><day>\\
    /f - (optional) file format of organised file ie to give a new file name
        string format {0} date photo taken eg {0:yyyyMMdd_HHmmss}
        string format {1} file name
        string format {2} files extension
        default is original filename eg "{1}.{2}"
        dont forget to include extension eg
    /c - (optional) copy files instead of move
    /s - (optional) search sub directories
    /p - (optional) System.IO.Directory.GetFiles search pattern
        default is *.jpg
    /l - (optional) list only, don't change a thing!

Remarks:
    Destination path is relative to the source path not from where the tool is run; unless a full path is used.
    For the file format (/f) argument don't forget to include file extension eg "{1}.{2}".

Examples:
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe "C:\MyPhotos"
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe "C:\MyPhotos" /c /l
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe "C:\MyPhotos" /s /d "C:\SortedPhotos\{0:yyyy}\{0:MM}"
    MyPhotoOrganiser.exe "C:\MyPhotos" /s /f "{0:yyyyMMdd_HHmmss}{1}.{2}"
